                         ------------------

  This file explains how to use THELP.COM. THELP is a memory-resident
  utility that provides online help for Turbo Assembler. If you are using
  Turbo Debugger, for example, you can load THELP, then run Turbo
  Debugger and get online help for Turbo Assembler while you are debugging.

1.  STARTING THELP
------------------

  Load THELP at the DOS command line simply by typing THELP. Make sure
  the Turbo help file is in the current directory or use the /F command
  line option (described below). The INSTALL program inserts the correct
  path information in THELP.

    Memory usage
      THELP requires about 21K bytes.

    Default hot key
      The default hot key is Numeric-Keypad-5 (scan code 4ch,
      shift state 00h).

  If you are using SideKick Plus or SideKick 1.x, make sure you
  load THELP before you load SideKick.


2. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS SUMMARY
-------------------------------

    USAGE:  THELP [options]

  Here is a summary of THELP's command line options. If you use more
  than one option, you must separate them with spaces.

    /C#xx     Select color: #=color number, xx=hex color value
    /Fname    Full path and file name of help file
    /H,/?,?   Display this help screen
    /Kxxyy    Change hot key: xx=shift state(hex), yy=scan code(hex)
    /S+       Enable snow checking for video (useful for older CGA adapters).
    /S-       Disable snow checking for video (for snappier displays).
    /U        Remove THELP from memory
    /W        Write options to THELP.COM and exit


3. Detailed Explanation of Keys Used When THELP is Active
---------------------------------------------------------

    Arrow keys:  Moves the cursor.
    PgUp/PgDn:   Moves the cursor up/down one screen.

    Shift-Arrow: Moves the cursor while marking a block.

    TAB:         Moves the cursor to the next keyword.
    Shift-TAB:   Moves the cursor to the previous keyword.

    HOME:        Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
    END:         Moves the cursor to the end of the line.

    ENTER:       Selects help entry for the item highlighted in the
                 current help screen.

    ESC:         Ends Help.

    F1:          Displays the Help Table of Contents

    Shift-F1:    Help Index. Shift-F1 from any help screen brings up
                 the Help Index.  You can search for a specific keyword
                 incrementally.  For example, you can find "fardata" by
                 typing f a r d.  With each letter you type, the list
                 jumps to the keyword that starts with f, then to fa,
                 then to far, etc.

    ALT-F1:      Displays in reverse order the last 20 screens you
                 have reviewed.

    CTRL-P key:  Pastes the marked block or the example text into
                 the application.



4.  DETAILED EXPLANATION OF COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------

  /C#xx     Select color: #=color number, xx=hex color value

  There are twelve possible colors, described as follows:

    0 = Color border attribute
    1 = Monochrome border attribute
    2 = Color text attribute
    3 = Monochrome text attribute
    4 = Color keyword attribute
    5 = Monochrome keyword attribute
    6 = Color selected keyword attribute
    7 = Monochrome selected keyword attribute
    8 = Color example text attribute
    9 = Monochrome example text attribute
    A = Color marked block attribute
    B = Monochrome marked block attribute

  The color numbers for a standard IBM-compatible Color Display are
  as follows:

  First Digit (Background)              Second Digit (Foreground)

  0 -- Black                            0 -- Black
  1 -- Blue                             1 -- Blue
  2 -- Green                            2 -- Green
  3 -- Cyan                             3 -- Cyan
  4 -- Red                              4 -- Red
  5 -- Magenta                          5 -- Magenta
  6 -- Brown                            6 -- Brown
  7 -- Grey                             7 -- Grey
                                        8 -- Intense Black
   ORing the color value with           9 -- Intense Blue
   Hex 80 produces a blinking           A -- Intense Green
   color unless blinking has been       B -- Intense Cyan
   disabled.                            C -- Intense Red
                                        D -- Intense Magenta
                                        E -- Intense Brown (Yellow)
                                        F -- Intense Grey (White)

  On monochrome monitors, the attribute values can differ widely,
  so some experimentation would be needed.


  /Fname       Full path and name of help file

  The name that follows the /F option should be the full
  drive/directory path name of the help file to use; e.g.,

      THELP /FC:\TP\TURBO.HLP
      THELP /FC:\TASM\TASM.TAH

  By default, THELP looks for the help file on the logged drive and
  directory.


  /H,/?,?      Display help screen

  This option displays a summary of THELP's command line options


  /Kxxyy       Change hot key: xx=shift state, yy=scan code

  Virtually any shift state/scan code combination may be selected. A
  quick summary of some common shift-states and scan codes follows:

    Shift States (may be OR'ed together)

      right shift    01h
      left shift     02h
      control        04h
      alt            08h

    Scan Codes

      A   --- 1eh     N   --- 31h     0   --- 0bh     F1  --- 3bh
      B   --- 30h     O   --- 18h     1   --- 02h     F2  --- 3ch
      C   --- 2eh     P   --- 19h     2   --- 03h     F3  --- 3dh
      D   --- 20h     Q   --- 10h     3   --- 04h     F4  --- 3eh
      E   --- 12h     R   --- 13h     4   --- 05h     F5  --- 3fh
      F   --- 21h     S   --- 1fh     5   --- 06h     F6  --- 40h
      G   --- 22h     T   --- 14h     6   --- 07h     F7  --- 41h
      H   --- 23h     U   --- 16h     7   --- 08h     F8  --- 42h
      I   --- 17h     V   --- 2fh     8   --- 09h     F9  --- 43h
      J   --- 24h     W   --- 11h     9   --- 0ah     F10 --- 44h
      K   --- 25h     X   --- 2dh
      L   --- 26h     Y   --- 15h
      M   --- 32h     Z   --- 2ch


    Enhanced Keyboards only (may not work with all computers, keyboards)

      F11 --- 57h
      F12 --- 58h

  /S           Controls snow-checking logic for video.

  Some older CGA have a tendency to produce a "snow" effect when
  software tries to write directly into their memory space.  If you see
  this snow you should start up THELP with /S+ to enable the snow
  checking code.  You may want to use the /W switch (see below) to make
  it permanent.  Snow checking takes time and it is better to live
  without it.  To disable snow checking use /S-; this is the default.

  /U           Remove THELP from memory

  This option removes THELP from memory. If other TSRs have been
  loaded after THELP, make sure to remove them before removing
  THELP.


  /W           Write Options to THELP.COM and exit

  The /W parameter creates a new version of THELP that uses the
  options you desire as a default. All options may be specified
  and made "permanent."
