                         -----------------


  Turbo Link (TLINK) is an extremely fast and compact linker; it's invoked
  as a separate program and can also be used as a standalone linker. For 
  instructions on using TLINK as a standalone linker, look in Appendix D
  of the Turbo Assembler Reference Guide. This file contains extra information
  that is not in Appendix D.

  /s switch
  ---------
  When a detailed map is requested through use of the /s switch, the list of 
  public symbols (if it appears) has public symbols flagged with "idle" if 
  there are no references to that symbol. For example, this fragment from the 
  public symbol section of a map file indicates that symbols Symbol1 and 
  Symbol3 are not referenced by the image being linked:

    0C7F:031E    idle    Symbol1
    0000:3EA2            Symbol2
    0C7F:0320    idle    Symbol3


  /o switch (overlays)
  --------------------
  The /o option causes the code in all modules or libraries specified after 
  the option to be overlaid. It remains in effect until the next comma 
  (explicit or implicit) or /o- in the command stream. /o- turns off 
  overlaying.

  The /o option can be optionally followed by a segment class name; this 
  will cause all segments of that class to be overlaid. When no such name 
  is specified, all segments of classes ending with CODE will be overlaid. 
  Multiple /o options can be given, thus overlaying segments of several 
  classes; all /o options remain in effect until the next comma or /o- 
  is encountered.

  The syntax /o#xx, where xx is a two-digit hexadecimal number, overrides 
  the overlay interrupt number, which by default is 3FH.

  Here are some examples of /o options:

    /o             Overlay all code segments until next comma or /o-.

    /o-            Stop overlaying.

    /oOVY          Overlay segments of class OVY until the next comma
                   or /o-.

    /oCODE /oOVLY  Overlay segments of class CODE or class OVLY until next
                   comma or /o-.

    /o#F0          Use interrupt vector 0F0H for overlays.

  You can use the /o option in response files. If you use the /o option in a 
  response file, it will be turned off automatically before the libraries are 
  processed. If you want to overlay a library, you must use another /o right 
  before all the libraries or right before the library you want to overlay.


  /y (expanded or extended memory)
  --------------------------------
  This switch controls TLINK's use of expanded or extended memory for I/O 
  buffering. If, while reading object files or while writing the executable
  file, TLINK needs more memory for active data structures, it will either 
  purge buffers or swap them to expanded or extended memory.

  In the case of input file buffering, purging simply means throwing away the
  input buffer so that its space can be used for other data structures. In 
  the case of output file buffering, purging means writing the buffer to its 
  correct place in the executable file. In either case, you can substantially 
  increase the speed of a link by allowing these buffers to be swapped to 
  expanded or extended memory.

  TLINK's capacity is not increased by swapping; only its performance is 
  improved. By default, swapping to expanded memory is enabled, while 
  swapping to extended memory is disabled. If swapping is enabled and no 
  appropriate memory exists in which to swap, then swapping does not occur.

  This switch has several forms, shown below

    /ye   enable expanded memory swapping (default)
    /ye   disable expanded memory swapping
    /yx   enable extended memory swapping
    /yx-  disable extended memory swapping (default)
